# Workshop-5-REST-Server

The purpose of this workshop is to write a fully functional back-end REST server for the front-end app from Workshop 4. For creating our API I'm usingSpring MVC and external library Jackson.

User can view, add, remove and edit book from the list that is kept in the server memory and initialized upon server start.
